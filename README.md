# Julia Function Bug: Unexpected 0 Return for Negative Input

This repository demonstrates a bug in a simple Julia function that unexpectedly returns 0 for negative inputs. The function is designed to square positive numbers and return 0 for non-positive numbers.  However, there is an issue causing it to always return 0 for negative numbers.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.jl` provides the corrected version.

## Bug Description

The function `myfunction` is expected to behave as follows:

- Positive input: Return the square of the input.
- Non-positive input (0 or negative): Return 0.

However, the current implementation incorrectly returns 0 for all negative inputs.

## Solution

The bug is resolved by ensuring the conditional logic correctly handles negative inputs. The corrected function in `bugSolution.jl` addresses this issue.
